[] What is git.
    Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from
    small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple 
    developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each 
    other's work. Git tracks changes to files, allowing you to revert to previous 
    versions, collaborate with others,and maintain a history of your project.

[] For initializing the git used command:-
   command:- git init  
    command:- git init -b BranchName

    o/p:-
    Initialized empty Git repository in D:/Project And Program COde/GIT/.git/

[] See the Status:-
    command:- git status

    o/p:-
    On branch Main    # The "main" branch you see by default is "master". If you want to change "master" to another name, you can specify the branch name at the time of git initialization.

    No commits yet

[] Types of Files in Git Status
    1. Untracked: New files that Git does not yet track.
    2. Modified: Files that have been changed.
    3. Staged: Files that are ready to be committed.

   command:- git add filename    #For Single file
    command:- git add .           #For all files

[] if you want to unstage the file then used
    command:- git -rm --cached <filename>

[] View the commit history:
    command:- git log

[] Commit changes to the repository:
    command:- git commit -m "commit message"    # Commit with a message

[] If you want to skip the staging area, then use this command:
    command:- git commit -a -m "commit message"

[] if you want see the what changes happened in the file then used this command
    command:- git diff

[] To see the changes between the staging area and the last commit, use this command:
    command:- git diff --staged    

[] To delete the file into staging area you can use that this command.
    command:- git reset HEAD filename
    command:- git rm --cached filename

[] Steps to upload repository content to a remote repository using HTTP URL: 
    Step 1:- Initialize a new Git repository (if not already initialized):
              Command:- git init
        

    Step 2:- Add all files to the staging area:
             Command:- git add .
       

    steps 3:- Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message:
              command:- git commit -m "Your commit message"
       

    Step4:- Add the remote repository URL:
            command:- git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
        

    Step 5:- Push the changes to the remote repository: 
             command:- git push -u origin branchName
        

    Note: Replace `<remote-repository-URL>` with the actual URL of your remote repository.
